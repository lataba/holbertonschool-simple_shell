COMPILING

        ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
        The hsh program is a simple shell written in C.
        The shell accepts commands from the user and executes them, emulating the behavior of a Unix terminal


USAGE
        There are two ways to run the hsh shell:

        Interactive mode: where the "$" prompt appears for the user to enter commands. The prompt will repeat until "exit" or "Ctrl + D" is executed.

        Non-interactive mode: where the output of a command can be sent as input to the ./hsh program using the pipe command.

        If no script file is provided, the shell will run in interactive mode.

EXAMPLES
        - Execute simple commands:
        $ ./hsh
        $ ls

        - Execute commands whit arguments:
        $ ./hsh
        $ ls -l

        - Non-interactive mode:

        $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
